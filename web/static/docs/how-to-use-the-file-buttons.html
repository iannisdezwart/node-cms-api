		<p>
			When you click on the "Copy" button, you will see a popup like this:
		</p>

			<br>
			(Optionally, you could change the file name of the copied file below "Fill in the name of the file".)
			<br>
			Then click on "Select folder". Now the file will get copied and you will get a confirmation popup message like this:
